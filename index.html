        Greetings. My name's Connor Hoy! I am a web developer in training at UNCC Web Development boot camp, and I'm a Private First Class in the North Carolina Army National Guard. My experiences in the guard have granted me with additional lessons in leadership, commitment and hard work. All virtues that I take with me in my everyday life.  
        <br><br>
        For over a decade now I've been tinkering with SQM and SQL programming through the ArmA and VBS2 engine, and I've enjoyed that exstinsevly. I have always had an interest in technology and creating experiences for others. I hope to one day take both interest's and incorporate them into a career, whether it be web development or another form of programming. When I'm not working, I enjoy utilizing my free time to go hiking, conduct physical fitness, or just relax and play some video games.
        </p>
